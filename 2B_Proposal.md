# Proposal

### Introduction
We're will be using our RP2040 microcontroller/s to design a fun LED reaction mechanism.\
We plan to use an RGB LED, a buzzer and a push button.\
We will create different combinations:
- push the button in slow intervals --> change the color of the LED
- push the button in fast intervals --> buzzer sound

### Principles and Use
- Serial communication with the microcontroller for some inputs in the initial attempts
- GPIO pins for input from pushbuttons
- GPIO pins for output to LEDs and buzzer

### Components
- RP2040 microcontroller
- RGB LEDs
- LED Matrix (8x8 or 16x32)
- Buzzer
- Pushbuttons
- Multiple 100 Ohm Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

### Additional
- If the circuit works well, we would like to involve the use of sensors later on.
- Not finalised but could use the APDS-9960 and/or other sensors in the lab

##### Accepting all kinds of weird and fun suggestions (that do not damage the microcontroller and sensors) :D
