### How it works:

Neopixel continuously toggles between yellow colour and no colour. \
When the boot button is pressed, it acts as an indication to stop this action so no colour on Neopixel. \
When the boot button is pressed again, it starts the action. \
Thus, for alternative presses of the boot button the action stops or runs.
